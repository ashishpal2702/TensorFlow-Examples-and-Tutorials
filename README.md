TensorFlow v1
The tutorial index for TF v1 is available here: TensorFlow v1.15 Examples. Or see below
for a list of the examples.
Dataset
Some examples require MNIST dataset for training and testing. Don't worry, this dataset
will automatically be downloaded when running examples. MNIST is a database of
handwritten digits, for a quick description of that dataset, you can check this notebook.
Official Website: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
